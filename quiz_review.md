**Question:** How many tickets in total are sold after 5 days? Create a graph showing the cumulative number of tickets sold. What is the formula for the total amount raised?

## Question 5: Pizza Party Planning 🍕

**Scenario:** A class plans a pizza party where each pizza costs $10 and serves 3 students. The number of students attending increases by 2 each day from an initial count of 5.

**Question:** How many pizzas are needed each day for 5 days? Graph the relationship between the number of students and pizzas needed. What is the formula to determine the number of pizzas needed based on the number of students?

## Question 6: The Book Club Points 📚

**Scenario:** Each book read in the book club earns a student 5 points. Starting with 10 points, students aim to accumulate at least 50 points by reading more books each week.

**Question:** If a student reads one more book than the previous week, starting with 1 book in the first week, how many books in total will they have read by the time they reach their goal? Create a graph of points accumulated over time. What is the formula for total points based on the number of books read?

## Question 7: The Bike-a-thon Challenge 🚴

**Scenario:** Participants in a bike-a-thon raise $20 for every mile they bike. Each participant aims to double the miles biked from the previous day, starting with 1 mile on the first day.

**Question:** How much money will one participant raise after 4 days? Graph the relationship between miles biked and money raised. Write the formula for the money raised based on miles biked.

## Question 8: The Cookie Sale Expansion 🍪

**Scenario:** A scout troop sells cookies for $4 a box. On the first day, they sell 30 boxes. Each subsequent day, they aim to sell twice as many boxes as the day before.

**Question:** How many boxes will they sell in 5 days? Create a graph showing daily and cumulative sales. What is the linear (or exponential for challenge) formula for daily sales?

## Question 9: Car Wash for a Cause 🚗

**Scenario:** A group organizes a car wash charging $10 per car. They wash 10 cars on the first day. Each day, they wash an additional car (i.e., one more car than the previous day).

**Question:** How much money will they have raised after 7 days? Graph the daily and total earnings. What is the formula for total earnings after any number of days?

## Question 10: The Recycling Drive Initiative ♻️

**Scenario:** A community center pays $0.10 for each recycled can. A family starts with recycling 50 cans on the first day and increases their effort by recycling 20% more cans each subsequent day.

**Question:** How much money will the family earn from recycling cans over a week? Create a graph to show the daily increase in cans recycled and the corresponding earnings. What is the formula for the money earned from recycling cans?
