# Exploring the Relationship Between Height and Arm Span 📏🤲

## Objective 🎯
To measure the height and arm span of classmates, record these measurements, graph them, and explore their relationship. Aim to create a simple function that explains this relationship.

## Materials 🛠️
- Measuring tape (cm or inches)
- Graph paper
- Pencil and eraser
- Calculator

## Part 1: Measurement 📐 15 mins
1. **Form groups** of at least four students. 🕒 (5 min)
2. **Measure the height** of each group member. 🕒 (10 min)
3. **Measure the arm span** of each group member. 🕒
4. **Record your measurements** in the table. 🕒 

### Data Recording Table 📋
Record the data using these three columns 

| Student Name | Height | Arm Span |



## Part 2: Graphing 📊 10 mins
1. **Plot the data** on graph paper, using height for the x-axis and arm span for the y-axis. 🕒 (5 min)
2. **Label each axis** with the correct measurement unit. 
3. **Draw points** for each set of measurements and **connect the dots** if a pattern is visible. 🕒 (5 min)

## Part 3: Creating a Function ➗ 10 Mins
1. **Analyze the graph** to identify if the relationship between height and arm span appears linear. 🕒 (5 min)
2. **Discuss and propose a simple function** (e.g., `y = x` or `y = x + a`) that might describe this relationship. 🕒 (5 min)

## Reflection Questions 🤔
1. How well did your function describe the relationship between height and arm span?
2. Were there any outliers in your data? Why do you think they exist?
3. What did you learn about the relationship between a person's height and their arm span?
